### Learn MongoDB

After a bunch of faffing about I've come to realize that I need to learn how to build some sort of working backend for my Herding Cats Travel App. The app is currently running on Vercel's serverless function and is thereby read-only. Now I want to expand into having full intended functionality, hence, new project, learn MongoDB. Wish me luck.
